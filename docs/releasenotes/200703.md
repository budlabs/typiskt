### 2020.07.03.2
A bug in [go-md2man](https://github.com/cpuguy83/go-md2man/issues/59) caused the whole manpage looking like a overthrown table, i forked go-md2man and is using my version to render this manpage. Also added options to set colors in the config. (*if you installed **typiskt** prior to this release you may have to manually add these to the configfile*)  

```
# color of active word depending on status
# value should be an integer 0-15
# in the background tput setaf $status-color-error
# is used to generate the escape code
status-color-error = 1
status-color-correct = 2
status-color-active = 3
```

thanks @BachoSeven from issue #7
