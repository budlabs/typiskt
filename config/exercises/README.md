when **typiskt** is executed with the `--exercise ARG` option, it will look in this directory for a sub directory with the same name as ARG. **typiskt** doesn't come with any exercises, but executing the script: `add-gtypist-exercises.sh` will download and convert the default English exercises from <https://github.com/inaimathi/gtypist-single-space>, and add them to this directory.
