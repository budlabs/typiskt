.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
You will get a different type of test depending
on which mode you start \fBtypiskt\fP in. No matter
which mode you can press Escape to
restart the test, and Ctrl+c
to quit.

.SS words
.PP
This is the default mode and it will use words
taken from a corpus and show them in a random
order, the test will stop when the time is up. If
time was more then 60 seconds, the "score" will
get recorded. The default corpus is \fIenglish\fP, but
it can be changed to any corpus listed with
\fB\fC\-\-list\fR, using the \fB\fC\-\-corpus\fR options. If
\fB\fC\-\-difficulty\fR is set, some words will have a
random \fIwordmask\fP applied to them making the test
more difficult, difficulty will also add some
bonus point to the high score.

.SS book
.PP
This is very similar to the words mode, except
the words are taken from a specific textfile (the
argument to \fB\fC\-\-book\fR) and will be displayed in
chronological order. It will also record the word
the test ended on, so if a new test is started
with the same text, it will resume on that word
(\fBbookmark\fP).

.SS source
.PP
Will also print words in chronological order from
a specific file (the argument to \fB\fC\-\-source\fR)  but
unlike \fBbook mode\fP it will respect Line\-breaks.
time limit, bookmark and difficulty is disabled
for this mode. It is intended for (short) snippets
of source code. The highest WPM for the file will
be stored and displayed when the test is
completed.

.SS exercise
.PP
The argument to \fB\fC\-\-exercise\fR must be the name of
a subdirectory in
\fBTYPISKT\_CONFIG\_DIR/exercises\fP\&. That
subdirectory in turn is expected to contain one or
more wordlists (files with one word/line). The
content of these wordlists will be displayed in
chronological order. And to proceed to the next
exercise/wordlist (sorted in numerical order with
\fB\fCsort \-n\fR) a certain WPM and accuracy must be
reached (the values can be changed in
\fBTYPISKT\_CONFIG\_DIR/config\fP). You can navigate
between \fBcompleted\fP exercises with the
Arrow keys in this mode. No exercises
is included with the installation, but the script:
\fB\fCTYPISKT\_CONFIG\_DIR/exercises/add\-gtypist\-exercises.sh\fR
will download, convert and install the default
English exercises from [gtypist].

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\fC\-\-corpus\fR|\fB\fC\-c\fR WORDLIST
.br
changes WORDLIST to use in the default
(\fBwords\fP) mode. Defaults to \fIenglish\fP\&. This
value can also be set in
\fB\fCTYPISKT\_CONFIG\_DIR/config\fR or with the
environment variable \fBTYPISKT\_WORDLIST\fP\&.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-difficulty\fR|\fB\fC\-d\fR INT
.br
INT must be a number 0\-10, the higher the
difficulty the more often a wordmask will be
applied to words in modes that supports
\fB\fC\-\-difficulty\fR (words|book).

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-time\fR|\fB\fC\-t\fR SECONDS
.br
Number of seconds a test will last in modes that
supports \fB\fC\-\-time\fR (words|book). Defaults to 60.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-width\fR|\fB\fC\-w\fR WIDTH
.br
Maximum width in columns for lines. Defaults to:
\fB\fCmin(50,COLUMNS\-2)\fR

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-seed\fR|\fB\fC\-s\fR INT
.br
Seed to be used for RANDOM. Defaults to \fB\fC$(od \-An
\-N3 \-i /dev/random)\fR

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-book\fR|\fB\fC\-b\fR TEXTFILE
.br
Sets mode to \fBbook\fP and uses TEXTFILE as a
wordlist.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-source\fR|\fB\fC\-u\fR TEXTFILE
.br
Sets mode to \fBsource\fP and uses TEXTFILE as a
wordlist.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-exercise\fR|\fB\fC\-e\fR EXERCISE
.br
Sets mode to \fBexercise\fP and looks in
\fBTYPISKT\_CONFIG\_DIR/exercises/EXERCISE\fP for
files to generate wordlists.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-list\fR|\fB\fC\-l\fR
.br
List available wordlists in \fBWORDLIST\_DIR\fP
(defaults to \fB\fC/usr/share/typiskt/wordlist\fR or
\fB\fCSCRIPTDIR/wordlists\fR).

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-help\fR|\fB\fC\-h\fR
.br
Show help and exit.

.PP
\fB\fC\-\-version\fR|\fB\fC\-v\fR
.br
Show version and exit.
